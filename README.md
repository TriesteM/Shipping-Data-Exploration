# Shipping-Data-Exploration
Spatial data exploration and clustering analyses.


This is a survey of spatial clustering algorithms using shipping event data.  The data aren't mine, but I used R Markdown to render the results to html, along with interpretation and some discussion, and the document can serve as reference for the application and interpretation of various spatial clustering tools.
